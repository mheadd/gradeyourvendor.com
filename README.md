# Grade Your Vendor

Uber, Etsy, eBay and many other companies use rating and reputational systems to enable millions of transactions and have fundamentally changed the rules of commerce. What if the same appraoch could be used by governments and vendors when public sector entities procure technology services.

**Grade Your Vendor** is an effort to explore how this could work.

Got an idea or suggestion for how this should work? Open an issue and drop your comment [here](https://github.com/mheadd/gradeyourvendor.com/issues).

More updates soon (I hope).
